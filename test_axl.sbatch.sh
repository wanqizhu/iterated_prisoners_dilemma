# Quality of Service (QOS); think of it as sending your job into a special queue; --qos=long for with a max job length of 7 days.
# uncomment ##SBATCH --qos=long if you want your job to run longer than 48 hours, which is the default for normal partition,  
# NOTE- in the hns partition the default max run time is 7 days , so you wont need to include qos, also change to normal partition 
# since dev max run time is 2 hours.
##SBATCH --qos=long
# We are submitting to the dev partition, there are several on sherlock: normal, gpu, bigmem (jobs requiring >64Gigs RAM)

#number of nodes you are requesting, the more you ask for the longer you wait

#################
# --mem is memory per node; default is 4000 MB per CPU, remember to ask for enough mem to match your CPU request, since 
# sherlock automatically allocates 4 Gigs of RAM/CPU, if you ask for 8 CPUs you will get 32 Gigs of RAM, so either 
# leave --mem commented out or request >= to the RAM needed for your CPU request.  It will also accept mem. in units, ie "--mem=4G"
#SBATCH --mem=40000
# to request multiple threads/CPUs use the -c option, on Sherlock we use 1 thread/CPU, 16 CPUs on each normal compute node 4Gigs RAM per CPU.  Here we will request just 1.

# Have SLURM send you an email when the job ends or fails, careful, the email could end up in your clutter folder
